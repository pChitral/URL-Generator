# URL Generator

## Why did I write it? 
So while I was preparing for the GRE, I followed a wordlist by GregMAT. Whenever I came across a new word, I used to google how it is used in a sentence to comprehend it and not simply memorize its meaning. After repeating this for quite a while, I couldn't help but find a shortcut. Thus, I had written this to generate the URL of the words from the GregMAT list.  

## What does it do?
The code takes input from the CSV file "file_name" and then generates the URL, which finally gets exported in an excel file. I used to open all the links simultaneously, removing the need to type it explicitly for 900 words in the list. 
## What if you want to generate a URL for some different website? 
Simple open the "URL Generator.ipynb" file and change the variable  "url," which is sitting in the for loop.
