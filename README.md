# URL Generator

## Why did I write it? 
So while I was preparing for the GRE, I followed a wordlist by GregMAT. Whenever I came across a new word, I used to google how it is used in a sentence to comprehend it and not simply memorize its meaning. After repeating this for quite a while, I couldn't help but find a shortcut. Thus, I had written this to generate the URL of the words from the GregMAT list.  

## What does it do?
The code takes input from the CSV file <code>file_name</code> and then generates the URL, which finally gets exported in an excel file. I used to open all the links simultaneously, obviating the need to type it explicitly for 900 words in the list. 
## What if you want to generate a URL for some different website? 
Simply open the <code>URL_Generator.ipynb</code> file and change the variable <code>url</code> which is sitting in the for loop, with the URL of your choice.
